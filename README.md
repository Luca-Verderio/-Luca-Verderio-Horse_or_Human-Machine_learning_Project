# Image Classification: Horse-or-Human
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, to classify images of horses from images of humans.

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model has been created using transfer learning, where the "inception_v3" model has been imported and the following layers have been added:
- Flatten
- Dense
- Dropout
- Dense

## Data
The original data set is the following:  
-	[Horse-or-Human Data Set](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/horse-or-human.zip)

## Tools
Programming language: **Python**  
Python libraries: **TensorFlow**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**  
Environment: **Google Colab Notebook**
